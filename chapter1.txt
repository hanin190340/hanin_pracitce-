In the quiet village of Elmsworth, a young villager named Taren found a strange map hidden beneath the floorboards of his grandmother’s old cottage. The paper was worn and yellow, its edges curling like old leaves, and it showed a path leading deep into the Whispering Woods—a forest no one dared enter. The trees there were said to whisper secrets to those who listened too long, driving them mad. But something about the map called to Taren. With the rising sun at his back and curiosity in his heart, he took his first step toward the shadows of the unknown.
Elara walked into the Whispering Woods. The trees were tall and quiet. The light from the sun was dim, and the ground was soft with moss. She felt a little scared, but also curious. Each step was slow and careful. She held the map tight and kept going.
