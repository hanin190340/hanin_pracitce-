Elara followed the path marked on the map and uncovered an ancient grove filled with glowing stones. As she placed the map on the central stone, the forest whispered its final secret: a blessing for those brave enough to seek it. Elara returned to Elmsworth with newfound wisdom and seeds from the grove. The once-quiet village flourished, and Elara’s journey became a tale of hope passed down through generations.

Elara vanished into the heart of the Whispering Woods, following the path until the forest swallowed her whole. The villagers searched, but no trace was ever found. Some say you can still hear her footsteps if you listen closely among the trees. The map was never seen again, and the woods grew darker, hungrier, with each passing year.


 tragic-ending
Elara followed the path marked on the map and reached the ancient grove hidden deep in the Whispering Woods. As she activated the grove’s magic, a wave of light spread through the forest, lifting the curse that had haunted it for centuries. But Elara never returned. The villagers later found the grove in bloom, her cloak folded neatly on the central stone. Elmsworth prospered, forever grateful to the one who gave everything to bring back the light.
