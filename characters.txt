Taren is a young villager with messy brown hair and bright green eyes. He wears simple clothes and carries a small leather pouch. Taren is curious by nature and often explores the edges of the village. When he finds the old map, his sense of adventure grows even stronger.
Elara sat by the window, holding the old map in her hands. The lines were faint, but she could see a trail marked in red ink, winding deep into the forest. A small symbol near the edge caught her eyeâ€”it looked like a sun surrounded by trees. She traced the path with her finger, feeling a strange pull in her chest. No one in the village dared to go near the Whispering Woods, but something about the map made her believe she had to go.

The next morning, Elara packed a loaf of bread, a flask of water, and the map into her satchel. She tied her cloak tightly and stepped outside as the first light touched the trees. The air was cool and still. Her heart beat fast, but her steps were steady. Without telling anyone, she walked past the fields and toward the dark edge of the forest, ready to follow the path that waited inside.
