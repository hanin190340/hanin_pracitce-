Taren is a young villager with messy brown hair and bright green eyes. He wears simple clothes and carries a small leather pouch. Taren is curious by nature and often explores the edges of the village. When he finds the old map, his sense of adventure grows even stronger.
Shadow is a sleek, black wolf with piercing silver eyes and a quiet, watchful nature. He has been by Elaraâ€™s side since she rescued him as a pup. Fiercely loyal and brave, Shadow moves like a shadow through the trees, always alert to danger and protective of Elara on every path.
